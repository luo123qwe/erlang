MODULE SUMMARY

	Functions for Manipulating Sets as Ordered Lists


DESCRIPTION

    Sets are collections of elements with no duplicate elements. An ordset is a representation of a set, where an ordered list is used to store the elements of the set. An ordered list is more efficient than an unordered list.
    
    This module provides exactly the same interface as the module sets but with a defined representation. One difference is that while sets considers two elements as different if they do not match (=:=), this module considers two elements as different if and only if they do not compare equal (==).
